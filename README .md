Student Performance Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI Dashboard created to analyze and visualize the factors influencing student academic performance. The dashboard leverages data from various sources to provide actionable insights on attendance, gender differences, and parental education impacts on student outcomes.

Description

The Student Performance Dashboard focuses on answering key questions related to academic success. Using a structured dataset, the dashboard highlights:
    1.    Attendance and Academic Success: How attendance levels correlate with final grades.
    2.    Gender-Based Performance Trends: Average grades across different periods by gender.
    3.    Parental Education Influence: The impact of parental education levels on student outcomes.

Tools Used
    •    Microsoft Power BI: To create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
    •    Microsoft Excel: For initial data cleaning and preparation.

Acknowledgments

This project was undertaken as part of training with Velonty, which required the completion of an individual project to showcase the skills acquired during the program. I chose to work with educational data to analyze factors influencing student performance, leveraging the analytical techniques and tools covered in the training. I am grateful for the guidance and resources provided through the program that made this project possible.
